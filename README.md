# oot
This is my working area as I create new OOT custom modules for gnuradio.
Mostly I will be adding message ports, but for some (e.g. selector) I will be pulling in changes that are available in newer version of gnuradio than I am able to run.

<h3>
  MySelector
</h3>
<p>
  This is a copy of the "selector" block from gnuradio version 3.10.
  Because Raspberry Pi gnuradio is at version 3.4, I am bringing in the updated selector block code, via this OOT block

  Text for the next module.
